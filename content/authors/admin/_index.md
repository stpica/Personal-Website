I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Boston University Economics Department](http://www.bu.edu/econ/).

My research focuses on macroeconomics. My fields of interest are monetary policy, real estate, and household finance.

I will be on the 2022 Job Market and available for interviews at the virtual EJME and ASSA.

<!-- A complete list of my research projects is outlined in my [research page](https://www.stefanopica.com/research/). -->

<!-- I am currently visiting the European Central Bank as part of the [Summer Research Graduate Programme](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/economic-research/programmes/graduate/html/index.en.html). -->

<!-- My research focuses on the interaction between monetary policy and the housing market, using household surveys to inform models. I am also interested in uncovering the effects of central banks’ communications on the macroeconomy using text analysis. You can find the list of my research projects in my [research page](https://www.stefanopica.com/research/). -->

<!-- I have [teaching](https://stpica.github.io/teaching/) experience at the graduate level as instructor of the first-year PhD macroeconomics course at Boston University. -->
