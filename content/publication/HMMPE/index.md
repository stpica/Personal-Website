abstract: Monetary policy has heterogeneous effects across Euro Area countries in terms of aggregate consumption, price-to-rent, mortgage issuance, and mortgage rates. I show strong correlations between cross-country monetary policy effectiveness and housing and mortgage market institutions, namely the share of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) and the homeownership rate (HoR). I incorporate these features into a currency-union New Keynesian model with rich household balance sheets, which I calibrate to Spain and the Euro Area. My results reveal that higher shares in ARM are responsible for the sizable movements in mortgage-related variables, due to a strong pass-through to mortgage rates. On the other hand, fluctuations in house prices and price-to-rent ratios are determined by the HoR, as households with higher average ownership utility tend to change tenure status more willingly. ARM shares and the HoR interact to produce bigger swings in aggregate consumption.
