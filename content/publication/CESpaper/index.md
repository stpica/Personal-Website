abstract: "We study the joint behavior of households’ survey expectations for a wide range of macroeconomic and individual-level variables in the largest six euro area countries, both in the cross-section and time series. Although households disagree, their expectations are correlated in the cross-section. Two principal components explain a significant portion of the variance of all expectations. These components capture households’ perceptions of the sources of macroeconomic dynamics, with the first capturing supply-side views and the second component reflecting demand-side views. This structure of perceptions and disagreement is stable across countries and time and does not vary with demographic or socioeconomic characteristics. We then use these insights to identify two common factors driving expectations over time. The factors co-move strongly with measures of supply and demand disturbances and align well with a narrative based on increasing perceived inflationary pressures coming from supply after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."

<!-- <h1>Abstract</h1>

The euro area Consumer Expectation Survey queries households about their expectations for a wide range of macroeconomic and individual-level variables, including economic growth, inflation, house prices, interest rates, and personal income growth. We find strong correlations between these expectations, which we use to identify two principal components that explain a significant portion of the total variance. These components represent households’ perceptions of the sources of macroeconomic dynamics, with the first reflecting supply-side shocks and the second reflecting demand-side shocks. Despite their stability over time, these components provide differential variation in household realized consumption in both durables and nondurables, and in precautionary savings. Overall, our results suggest that – at least since 2020 – households have been expecting supply-side shocks to be more important than demand-side shocks for the evolution of the business cycle. -->
